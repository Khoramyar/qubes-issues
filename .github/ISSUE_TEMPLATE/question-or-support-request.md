qubes-issues is not the place to ask questions or request support. This includes, but is not limited to, troubleshooting questions and questions about how to do things with Qubes. These questions should instead be asked on the `qubes-users` [mailing list](https://www.qubes-os.org/support/). By contrast, qubes-issues is meant for tracking more general bugs, enhancements, and tasks that affect a broad range of Qubes users.

For more information, please see our our [issue reporting guidelines](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/reporting-bugs/). Thank you for your understanding.
